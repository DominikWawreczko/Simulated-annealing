## Simulated annealing
This is implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm. The purpose of this alghorithm is approximating the global optimum of a given problem.
In project we have 2 versions simple, and with remembering the best solution so far. Every element f.e. cooling schedule, stop condition, is easy to extend.
Library can help solve problems that can be wrapped in Solution Class with 2 methods: calculating fitness and generating new neighbour solution from sollution space.

## Technologies
* Java JDK11 - version 11.0.10
* Junit - version 5.5.2
* AssertJ - version 3.16.1

## Status
Project is:_finished_.
